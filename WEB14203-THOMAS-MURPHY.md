## Benugo Xmas App

For this project we had to come up with a Web App idea, with the aim of the user being able to interact with the app and filter through information provided to help them reach what they are looking for.

For my project, I decided to create an Web App for Benugo. I currently work full time for Benugo as a supervisor in Waterloo station, however I also often make marketing material for them, such as; posters, recruitment material, marketing material ect. I wanted to create this app for them to help push them to give me the work experience I need, in a field I would like to explore and within a company I'm familiar and passionate for. 

The aim of my Web App is to promote their new Christmas Menu. I thought this would be a fun app to make as it allows for customers to engage with the company in a more interesting way, to discover their new menu and values, as opposed to just pushing images ect across social media. 

My idea is simple. Users are greeted with the app, they then select if they want to find out about the new hot drinks or food they offer. It then takes them to a page with images of ingredients. The user simply must select 2/3 ingredients they like, and the app will filter through the new menu and take them to a screen where it shows them the new options with the ingredients they like. Once they like the sound of an option, it then takes them to a map which can geo-locate them or use their post code to help find the nearest Benugo.

All my blog posts are posted on my portfolio website. The blog posts that are related to this unit can be found here, [using this special link](http://thomasmurphy.work/web14203).

The wonderful. however, pretty non-existent app as it stands so far can be found here on [GH Pages](https://thomass96.github.io/Benugo-Xmas/Xmas%20App/) along with my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/thomass96/Benugo-Xmas)

You can find the beginning phase of my Firebase Pusher here on [Thimble](https://thimbleprojects.org/thomass96/127427/) where I will push the products, but first I need to fine-tune which pieces of information I want to display for the products.
